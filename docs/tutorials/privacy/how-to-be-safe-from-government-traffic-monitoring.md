## INCOMPLETE!

:::note

This guide is tailored to help you conceal your online network activity from both your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and government authorities.

## How the ISP can track our traffic?

ISPs (Internet Service Providers) have the capability to monitor and track various aspects of your internet activity. Let's take a look at the main few methods:

1. **Packet Inspection:**

   - ISPs can inspect the data packets that travel through their network to see the content of your online activities.

2. **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI):**

   - DPI is a more advanced form of packet inspection that involves analyzing the content of data packets in detail. This can reveal specific types of traffic like websites you visit, applications you use, etc...

3. **DNS Monitoring:**

   - ISPs may monitor Domain Name System (DNS) requests, which translates domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses. By logging DNS requests, ISPs can see which websites you visit.

4. **Traffic Logging:**

   - ISPs may log the source and destination IP addresses, as well as the amount of data transferred. This information may be used to create a profile of your online activities. Which is most probably is being sent to government authorities.

And also the various other methods that exist, like: Metadata Analysis, Maintaining Connection Logs, etc...

## VPN - Virtual Private Networks

A VPN, or Virtual Private Network, creates a secure and encrypted connection between your device and a server operated by the VPN service.

Instead of connecting directly to the internet, your traffic is routed through this tunnel, masking your IP address and providing a layer of privacy and security.

While some VPNs provide encryption, not all VPNs use the same level of encryption. It's essential to choose a VPN service that implements strong encryption protocols, like AES-256 (against [Packet Inspection and Deep Packet Inspection](#how-the-isp-can-track-our-traffic) by ISPs) .

<summary>Encrypted VPN vs. Non-Encrypted VPN</summary>

| **Risk Aspect** | **Non-Encrypted VPN** | **Encrypted VPN** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Data Security** | Vulnerable to interception and monitoring of data. | Encrypts data, providing a secure tunnel for transmission. |
| **Privacy Protection** | Potential exposure of sensitive information. | Helps in concealing IP addresses and protects user privacy. |
| **Logging Policies** | May log user activities, compromising privacy. | Reputable services have strict no-logs policies. |
| **Connection Security** | Lacks robust protection against potential attacks. | Enhances security through encryption and secure protocols. |
| **Trusted Servers** | Server connections might be unsecured and unreliable. | Reputable VPN services operate secure and reliable servers. |
| **Free VPN Risks** | Free services may monetize user data or show ads. | Paid services are more likely to prioritize user privacy. |
| **Legal Implications** | Legal issues may arise if involved in illegal activities. | Legitimate use helps maintain privacy without legal concerns. |

### Why use a VPN?

1. **To hide your IP address:**

The VPN server acts as an intermediary between your device and the internet. Your ISP sees the VPN server's IP address instead of your actual IP address. This helps to mask your identity and location, providing a layer of anonymity.

2. **To encrypt your internet traffic:**

When you connect to a VPN, your internet traffic is encrypted. This means that the data you send and receive is transformed into a secure, unreadable format. Even if your ISP monitors your traffic, all they see is encrypted data.

Once you've chosen and installed your preferred VPN, your online traffic becomes encrypted, preventing ISPs from conducting packet inspection to identify and track your activities. However, despite this secure setup, several issues persist.

Let's discuss about DNS to address these concerns.
