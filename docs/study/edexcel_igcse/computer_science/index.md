# Computer Science

This guide is for students to undertand the primary concepts related to the syllabus. 

Throughout this guide, the programming language of choice will be Python, just because its fast to write/type in examinations, unlike languages like Java, filled with a lot of boilerplate code. 

I won't include everything as there are some self-explanotry obvious theories and there's no use in mentioning them. 

:::warning note
This guide focuses on understanding concepts and should not be used as exam notes. It is not intended for crafting perfect exam answers but rather for grasping concepts.
