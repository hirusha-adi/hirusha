## Pseudocode

- I strongly suggest you to first learn some basic Python (in chapter 2), and then come to this section.

- Practice some questions on your own:
    - Write pseudocode to calculate the average of three numbers.
    - Create pseudocode to find the maximum of two numbers.
    - Write pseudocode to determine if a given number is even or odd.
    - Develop pseudocode to calculate the factorial of a given number.
    - Create pseudocode to check if a given year is a leap year or not.


## Algorithms

Before getting started in this part, i strongly suggest you to watch this video: You can ignore all the "C" code, and data types like 'struct' related to it. But watching this video will help you understand all the concepts required. Just ignore the coding parts as we will be doing it in python.
