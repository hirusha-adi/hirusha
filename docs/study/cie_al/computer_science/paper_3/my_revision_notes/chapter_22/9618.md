- learn to do node traversal (according to A* algorithm) and be able to understand exam questions confidently

- artificial neural networks
    - describe
        - a computer system modelled on a brain
    - why multiple hidden layers?
        - enables deep learning to take place
        - where the problem you are trying to solve has a higher complexity
            - requires more layers to solve
        - to enable neural networks to learn and make decisions of its own
        - to improve the accuracy of the result
    - how it enables machine learning?
        - intended to replicate how the human brains work
        - values assigned for each connections between the nodes
        - data is input at the "input layer" and passed into the system
        - they are analyzed at each hidden subsequent layer 
        - where the outputs are calculated
        - this process of training is repeated many times
            - to achieve optimium output
            - (re-inforcement learning takes place)
        - decisions can be made without being specifically programmed
        - the deep learning network will have created complex feature detectors
        - the output layer provides the results
        - back propagation of erros will be used to correct any errors that have been made
- A* algorithm
    - describe
        - used to find optimal path between two mapped locations
    - purpose?
        - to fing the shortest path
        - between two nodes
        - based on distance
- graphs
    - describe
        - structure used to model relationships between objects
    - how it aids?
        - artificial neural networks can be represented using graphs
        -  provides structures for relationships
            - provides relationship between nodes
        - AI problems can be solves as finding a path in the graph
        - graphs may be analyzed by many algorithms
            - eg: A*, Djistras algorithm
        - used in machine learning
        - eg: 
            - regression methods
            - back propagation of errors

- machine learning
    - describe
        - a program that improved its performance at certain tasks with experience
    - categories
        - supervised learning
            - describe
                - using known tasks
                - with given outcomes
                - to enable a computer program to improve its performance
                - in accomplishing a similar task
            - enables learning by 
                - mapping an input
                - to an ouput
                - based on example input-output pairs
        - unsupervised learning
            - describe
                - using large number of tasks
                - with unkown outcomes
                - to enable a computer program to improve its performance
                - in accomplishing a similar task
            - enables learning by 
                - allowing process to discover patterns
                - on its own
                - that were previously undetected
        - re-inforcement learning
            - describe
                - using large number of tasks
                - with unkown outcomes
                - **and use of a feedback**
                - to enable a computer program to improve its performance
                - in accomplishing a similar task
            - enables learning 
                - in an interactive environment
                - by trial and error
                - using own experiences
        - deep learning
            - simulated data processing capabilities of the humab brain to make decisions.
            - describe
                - use of artificial neural networks
                - that maintains a high number of different  layers
                - modelled on the human brain
                - deep learning uses many layers to progressively extract higher level features from the raw input
                - deep learning is a specialized form of machine learning
            - why use?
                - makes good use of unstructured data
                - outperforms other methods if data size is large
                - enables machines to process data in a non-linear approach
                - effective at identifying hidden patterns
                    - that cannot be seen by humans 
                    - or thats time consuming for humans to carry out
                - can provide more accurate outcomes (with a higher amount of hidden layers)
