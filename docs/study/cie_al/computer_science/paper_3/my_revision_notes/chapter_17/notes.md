- Protocols
    - why are protocols used?
        - protocols set standards for communication
        - protocols enable compatibility between devices from different manufacturers
        - it two devices were sending messages to each other, but using different protocols, they would not be able to communicate properly
    - four layers of the protocol suite:
        - application layer
            - protocols used:
                - http/https
                    - used for transfer of web pages from server to client
                    - for sending and recieving web pages / hypertext documents
                - ftp
                    - used for interactive file transfer
                    - for sending and recieving files over a network / between devices
                - smtp
                    - used for sending email messages
                    - for sending / uploading emails / push protocol
                - pop3/imap
                    - description/function:
                        - used for retrieval of email messages
                        - for recieving/downloading emails / pull protocol
                    - purpose:
                        - used by email clients to retrieve email messages (pull protocol)
                        - from a mail server (over a TCP/IP connection)
                        - keeps the server and client in sync (by not deleting the original email)
                        - allows a cop of the email to be downloaded from the mail server.
        - transport layer
            - description/function:
                - short 
                    - handles packets
                - long
                    - the Transport Layer breaks data into managable packets / performs segmentation
                    - it adds a packet header
                    - it recieved data from the application layer
                    - it sends the packets to the network layer
                    - it controls the flow of packets
                    - it handles the packet loss / corruption
            - protocols used:
                - SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security):
                    - purpose?
                        - the ssl and tls protocols provide communications securely over the network
                        - they provide encryption
                        - they enable two parties to identify and authenticate each other
                        - and communicate with confidentiality and integrity
                    - how it's used in client-server communication?
                        - a ssl/tls connection is initiated by an application
                        - which becomes the client
                        - the application which recieves the connection becomes the server
                        - every new sessions begins with a handshake (as defined by the protocols)
                        - server sends the digital certificate to the client
                        - the client vertifies the server's digital certificate
                        - and obtains the server's public key
                        - the encryption algorithms are agreed
                        - the symmetric sessions keys are generated / defined
        - internet layer
            - description/function:
                - short
                    - handles transmission of data using IP Addresses 
                    - provides best (optimal) route
                - long
                    - the internet layer identified the intended network and host
                    - it transmits packets to the data link layer / physical layer
                    - it routes the packets independetly throught the optimum route
                    - i addresses packets with their source and destination IP addresses
                    - it then uses an IP address and port number to form a socket
        - link layer / physical layer
            - description/function:
                - handles how data is physically sent

    - bit torrent protocol
        - what network model?
            - peer to peer
        - use?
            - file sharing
        - how it works?
            - BitTorrent client software made available
            - a computer joins a swarmby using this to load a torrent descriptor file
            - a server called a tracker that keeps records of all the computers in the swarm
            - and shares their IP addresses allowing them to connect to each other
            - one computer in the swarm must have a complete copy of the torrent to be shared
            - torrent is split into small pieces
            - pices of the torrent are both downloaded and uploaded
            - once a computer has a peiceit can become a seed and upload
            - leeches download much more than they upload

- transmitting data
    - circuit swithing
        - how it works?
            - a dedicated circuit
            - curcuit is established before transmission starts
            - data is transferred using the whole bandwidth
            - all data is tranferred over the same route
            - curcuit is released after transmission ends
        - when to use?
            - this is to be used where a dedicated path needs to be sustained throughout the call / communication
            - where the whole bandwidth is required
            - where real time communication is used
            - a typical application is standard voice communications / video streaming
        - good:
            - frames (data) arrive in order and do not need the reassembled
            - whole of bandwidth is available
            - dedicated communication channel increases the quality of transmission
            - data is transmitted with a fixed data rate
            - no waiting time at switches
            - suitable for long continuous communication
            - fast method of data transfer
            - data arrives in the same order it was sent
            - data can't get lost
            - data all follows the same route
            - better for real time
            - simple method of transfer
        - bad:
            - nobody else can use the same circuit even if it is idle
            - less secure as only one route used
    - packet switching
        - benefit:
            - accuracy
                - ensures accurate delivery of the message
            - completeness
                - missing packets can be easily detected and re-send request sent so the message arrives complete
            - resilience 
                - if a network changes the router can detect this and send the data another way to ensure it arrives
            - path also available to other users
            - does not use the whole bandwidth
            - allows simultaneous use of channel by multiple users
            - better security as packets hashed and sent by different routes
        - drawbacks:
            - time delays to correct errors
            - network problems may introduce errors in packets
            - required complex protocols for delivery
            - unsuitable for realtime transmission applications
            - time takes to re-assemble packets at the destination
        - how it works?
            - long answer
                - a large message is divided up into a group of smaller chunks of the same size called packets
                - the packet has a header and a payload
                - the header contains a source IP, destination IP and a sequence number
                - each packet is dispatches independently
                - and may travel along different routes
                - the packets may arrive out of order
                - and are re-assembled into the original message at the destination
                - if packets are missing / curropted, a re-transmission request is sent
            - short answer
                - data is split into packets
                - each packet is given it's own route
                - the routing for apcket depends on the congestion
                - packets may not arrive in the given order
        - what the router does? / role of the router?
            - the router examines the packet's header
            - it reads the IP address of the destination (from the packet header)
            - a router has access to a routing table
            - containing information about:
                - available hops
                - netmask
                - gateways
                - etc...
            - and the status of the routes along the route
            - the router decides on the best route (next hop)
            - and sends the packet on its next hop.
