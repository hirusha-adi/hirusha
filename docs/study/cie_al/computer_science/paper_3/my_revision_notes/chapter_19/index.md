- flip flops
    - describe
        - circuit
        -  with two states
        - used for data storage elements
        - to store 1 bit of data
    - why / purpose
        - to store a binary digit / single bit
    - description long
        - a flip-flop is a logic circuit
        - it has a two stable states
        - a flip-flop is used for storing 1 bit of data / memmory / registers
        - there are different types of flip-flop, for example: JK and SR
    - types
        - SR flip flop
            - has undefined state
            - remember how to draw this

        - JK flip flop
            - is stable
            - has a clock pulse


- karnaugh maps
    - always circle only even number of 1's next to each other
    - remeber the roll kind thing
    - examples:

        - in this case, we fully neglect output X
