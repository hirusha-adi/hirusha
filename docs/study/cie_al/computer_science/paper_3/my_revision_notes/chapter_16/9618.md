- mantissa-exponent form 
    - normalized: 
        - examples:
            - `1.0000 x 2^3` 
            - `0.0000 x 2^3`
        - be able to identify normalized and not-normalized form
        - is not normalized?
            - first two bits of the mantissa should be different for normalized number
            - because the mantissa starts with 00
    
    - when allocating less bits to mantissa
        - reduction in precision
        - as the number of bits in the mantissa has decreased
    - when allocating more bits to exponent
        - increase in range
        - as the number of bits in the exponent has increased

    - why 513 (>511) cannot be stored accurately as a normalized floating point number?
        - requires 11 bits to store accurately
        - reference to maximum (positive) number that can be stored = 511
        - denary 513 in binary is 1000000001
            - normalized is 0.1000000001
        - so, results in overflow
    - how store numbers greater than >511?
        - the number of bits for the mantissa must be increased
        - 11/12 bits mantissa and 5/4 bits exponent
    
    - storing a binary number as floating point number
        - good
        - bad
            - the precision of the number would be reduced
            - because the LSB of the original number has been lost (truncated)
    
    - why binary numbers stored in normalized form?
        - to store the maximum range of numbers in the minimum number of bytes
        - normalization minimises the number of leading zeros / ones represented
        - maximising the numbers of significant bits // maximising the (potential) precision of the number for the given number of bits
        - enables very large / small numbers to be stored with accuracy
        - avoids the possibility of many numbers have multiple representaions

- user defined data types
    - called records
    - purpose?
        - to create a new data type (from existing data types)
        - to allow data types not available in a programming language to be constructed
            - to extend the flexibility of the programming language
    - types:
        - enumerated data type
            - using memmory pointers
                - examples:
                    - 1: note the **^** infront of Parts
                    ```
                    // define the reference data type 
                    TYPE Parts = (Monitor, Keyboard, Mouse)

                    // use the pointer and reference to Parts
                    TYPE SelectParts = ^Parts
                    ```
            - examples:
                - `WeekEnd` stores data about the days that are not school days:
                ```
                TYPE WeekEnd = (Saturday, Sunday)
                ```
        - composite data type
            - examples:
                - `ClubMeet` type stores first, last names, the days to stay home without school
                ```
                // our enumerated data type
                TYPE WeekEnd = (Saturday, Sunday)

                // composite data type
                TYPE ClubMeet
                    DECLARE FirstName: STRING
                    DECLARE LastName: STRING
                    DECLARE Holiday: WeekEnd
                ENDTYPE                
                ```
