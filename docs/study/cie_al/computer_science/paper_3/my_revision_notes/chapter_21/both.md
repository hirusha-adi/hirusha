- cryptography

  - key cryptography
    - why use?
      - to ensure the message is authentic // came from a trusted source
      - to ensure that only the intended reciever is able to udnerstand the message
      - to ensure the message has not been altered during transmission
      - non repudiation, neither the sender or the reciever can deny the transmission that occured
    - two methods:
      - symmetric
        - description
          - a single is used
          - for both encryption and decryption
        - good
        - bad
          - key has to be exchanged securely
          - once compormised the key can be used to decrypt the both the sent and recieved messages
          - cannot ensure non-repudiation (proof of integrity and origin of data)
      - asymmetric
        - describe the process
          - the message to be sent is encrypted using reciepient's public key
          - the message is decrypted using the reciepient's private key (after it has been devlivered securely)
        - purpose
          - to provide better security
          - by using 2 different keys (a public key and private key)
          - one of the keys is used to encrypt the message
          - the **matching key** is used to decrypt the message
        - private key
          - what
            - private key is the unpublished key that is never transmitted anywhere
            - it has a matching public key
            - it is used to decrypt data that was encrypted with its matching public key
        - public key
      - symmetric vs asymmetric
        - symmetric encryption uses a single key and aysmmetric encryption uses a pair of keys
        - the symmetric single key is used by all, wheras only one of the keys for asymmetric encryption is available to everyone, the private key is always kept secret (only the public key is publicly available)
        - so, asymmetric is more secure
        - the risk of compormise is higher with symmetric encryption and asymmetric encryption is more secure
        - symmetric cryptography is a simple process that can be carried out quickly, but asymmetric encryption is more secure
        - the length of the keys in symmetric encryption are (usually) shorter than those for asymmetric encryption (128/256 bits vs 2048 bits)
  - quantam cryptography
    - what?
      - to produce virtually unbreakable encryption system
      - using the principles of quantam mechanics (properties of photons)
      - detects eavesdropping
        - because the properties of photons change (if eavesdropped)
      - to protect security of data transmitted over fibre optic cables
      - to enable the use of longer keys
    - good
      - provides security based on laws of physics, rather than mathematical algorithms, so, more secure
      - to protect the security of data transmitted over fibre optic cables
      - virtually unhackable
      - the perofmance of quantam cryptography is continuously improved, making it suitable for most valuable government/industral secrets
      - longers keys can be used
      - any eavesdropping can be identified
      - integrity of the key once transferred can be gauranteed (cannot be copied and decrypted at a later date)
      - longer/more secure keys can be exchanged
    - bad
      - lacks many vital features like digital signatures, certified email, etc...
      - high cost of purcahsing / maintaining equipment required
      - limited range
      - error rates are high as technology is still being developed.
      - required dedicated fibre optic line and specialist hardware
      - cost of dedicated fibre optic line and specialist hardware is expensive
      - polarisation of light can change during transmission
        - polarisation of light may be altered whilst travelling down fibre optic cables
      - allows criminals and terrorists to hide their communications

- digital certificates

  - how a digital certificate is obtained
    - answer 1
      - enquiry made to certificate authority (CA)
      - enquirer's details checked by CA
      - if enquirer detauked verified by CA, then public key is agreed
      - CA issues certificate that includes the enquirer's public key
      - encrypting data sent to/by CA with the CA's public/private key
    - answer 2
      - the organization requests a certificate from the CA
      - the organization may send their public key to CA
      - the organization gathers all the information required by the CA in order to obtain their certificate, which included information to prove their identity
      - the CA veritified the organization's identity
      - the CA issues the certificate including the organization's public key (and other information)

- digital signature
  - how its produced
    - the message is hashed (with the agreed hashing algorithm)
    - to produce a message digest
    - the message digest is then encrypted with the sender's private key to form the digest
  - how it can be used to check weather the message is unaltered
    - the message together with the ditgital signature is decrypted using the reciever's private key
    - the digital signature recieved is decrypted with the sender's public key to recover the message digest sent
    - the decrypted message recieved is hashed with the agreed hashing algorithm to produce the message digest of the message recieved
    - the two message digests are compared
    - weather they are the same, and if it is, this means that the message has not been altered
