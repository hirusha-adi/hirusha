Some words used here might not be exactly correct. I'm just sticking with whats in the book. classes will be further discussed in other chaptersj under OOP.

## Records


```python
# class definition
# ---------------------------------------
class CarRecord:
    def __init__(self): # constructor
        self.VehicleID = ""
        self.Registration = ""
        self.DateOfRegistration = None
        self.EngineSize = 0
        self.PurchasePrice = 0.00

# example
# ---------------------------------------
ThisCar = CarRecord()
ThisCar.EngineSize = 2500

# make a list of 100 car records
Car = [CarRecord() for i in range(100)] 
Car[1].EngineSize = 2500
```

<details>
<summary>Pseudocode</summary>

- type definition

```
TYPE CarRecord
    DECLARE VehicleID : STRING // unique identifier and record key
    DECLARE Registration : STRING
    DECLARE DateOfRegistration : DATE
    DECLARE EngineSize : INTEGER
    DECLARE PurchasePrice : CURRENCY
ENDTYPE
```

- to declare a variable of this type CarRecord

```
DECLARE ThisCar : CarRecord
```

</details>

## File Processing

- **Random file**: a file that stores records at specific addresses that can be accessed directly

- Pseudocode File Operations:

| Structured English | Pseudocode |
| - | - |
| Create a file and open it for writing OPENFILE | `<filename> FOR WRITE` |
| Open a file in append mode | `OPENFILE <filename> FOR APPEND` |
| Open a file for reading | `OPENFILE <filename> FOR READ` |
| Open a file for random access | `OPENFILE <filename> FOR RANDOM` |
| Close a file | `CLOSEFILE <filename>` |
| Write a record to a file | `PUTRECORD <filename>, <identifier>` |
| Read a record from a file | `GETRECORD <filename>, <identifier>` |
| Move to a specific disk address within the file | `SEEK <filename>, <address>` |
| Test for end of file | `EOF(<filename>)` |

- Note that there are two new operations:

| Structured English | Pseudocode |
| - | - |
| Write a record to a file | `PUTRECORD <filename>, <identifier>` |
| Read a record from a file | `GETRECORD <filename>, <identifier>` |

- These can be used to directly store records (objects in our memmory) to a file (serialized)
- When needed, we can directly load that object to the memmory with pickles
- the `.pkl` or `.dat` file that stores this object is meaning less unless its loaded into memmory using the python's `pickle` module

#### Now, please refer to the [Pickles note](pickles) before continuing forward and come back
