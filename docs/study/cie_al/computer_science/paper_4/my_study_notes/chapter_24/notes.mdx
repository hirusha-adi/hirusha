## Concept of recursion

- Recursive routine: A function or procedure defined in terms of itself.

- Classic example: Factorial function (n!) 
    - with base case (0! = 1) 
    - and general case (n! = n × (n − 1)!)
    - e.g., 4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24

- Recursive solutions involve bringing the general case closer to the base case with each recursion.

- Key Terms:
    - **Base case**: An explicit solution to a recursive function.
    - **General case**: Definition of a recursive function in terms of itself.

## Programming a recursive subroutine

- A recursive subroutine must:
    - have a base case
    - have a general case
    - reach the base case aft er a finite (limited) number of calls to itself.

- Iterative Approach

```python
# Using a for loop
def factorial_iterative(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result

# Using a while loop
def factorial_while(n):
    result = 1
    while n > 1:
        result *= n
        n -= 1
    return result
```

- Recursive Approach

```python
def factorial_recursive(n):
    if n < 0: # this is a nice to have
        return "Factorial is not defined for negative numbers"
    elif n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial_recursive(n - 1)

# as a one line lambda function
fact = lambda n: 1 if ((n==0) or (n==1)) else n*fact(n-1)
```

<details>
<summary>Pseudocode</summary>

- Iterative Approach

```
FUNCTION Factorial(n : INTEGER) RETURNS INTEGER
    Result ← 1
    FOR i ← 1 TO n
        Result ← Result * i
    NEXT i
    RETURN Result
ENDFUNCTION
```

- Recursive Approach

```
FUNCTION Factorial(n : INTEGER) RETURNS INTEGER
    IF n = 0 THEN
        Result ← 1
    ELSE
        Result ← n * Factorial(n - 1)
    ENDIF
    RETURN Result
ENDFUNCTION
```

</details>

## Tracing a recursive subroutine

### Example 1

- basically dry run the algorithm

- consider this code below:

```python
def CountUpTo(n):
    if n > 0:
        CountUpTo(n - 1)
    print(n)

CountUpTo(3)
```

<details>
<summary>Pseudocode</summary>

```
PROCEDURE CountUpTo(n : INTEGER)
    IF n > 0 THEN
        CALL CountUpTo(n - 1)
    ENDIF
    OUTPUT n
ENDPROCEDURE

CALL CountUpTo(3)
```

</details>

- Note that the statements after `CountUpTo(n - 1)` are not executed until control
returns to this statement as the recursive calls unwind.

| Call Number | Procedure Call | n   | n > 0 | Output |
|-------------|-----------------|-----|-------|--------|
| 1           | CountUpTo(3)    | 3   | TRUE  | -      |
| 2           | CountUpTo(2)    | 2   | TRUE  | -      |
| 3           | CountUpTo(1)    | 1   | TRUE  | -      |
| 4           | CountUpTo(0)    | 0   | FALSE | 0      |
| (3)         | CountUpTo(1)    | 1   | TRUE  | 1      |
| (2)         | CountUpTo(2)    | 2   | TRUE  | 2      |
| (1)         | CountUpTo(3)    | 3   | TRUE  | 3      |

- Call number `4` is when the base case is reached
- call number `(3) -> (1)` is where the recursive call unwinds

### Example 2

- consider this code below:

```python
def Factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        result = 1
    else:
        result = n * factorial(n - 1)
    return result

Factorial(4)
```

<details>
<summary>Pseudocode</summary>

```
FUNCTION Factorial(n : INTEGER) RETURNS INTEGER
    IF n = 0 THEN
        Result ← 1
    ELSE
        Result ← n * Factorial(n – 1)
    ENDIF
    RETURN Result
ENDFUNCTION

Factorial(4)
```

</details>

- trace table:

| Call Number | Procedure Call  | n   | n = 0 | Result | Return Value |
|-------------|-----------------|-----|-------|--------| - |
| 1           | Factorial(4)    | 4   | FALSE | 4*Factorial(4)      | - |
| 2           | Factorial(3)    | 3   | FALSE | 3*Factorial(2)      | - |
| 3           | Factorial(2)    | 2   | FALSE | 2*Factorial(1)      | - |
| 4           | Factorial(1)    | 1   | FALSE | 1*Factorial(0)      | - |
| 5           | Factorial(0)    | 0   | TRUE  | 1      | 1 |
| (4)         | Factorial(1)    | 1   | FALSE | 1*1      | 1 |
| (3)         | Factorial(2)    | 2   | FALSE | 2*1      | 2 |
| (2)         | Factorial(3)    | 3   | FALSE | 3*2     | 6 |
| (1)         | Factorial(4)    | 4   | FALSE | 4*6     | 24 |


### Example 3

:::info NOTE

- **Convert Decimal Number to Binary Representation**
- Please remember this, because i have no idea about how it works.

:::

- Program Code:

```python
def int_to_binary(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        print(n)
    else:
        int_to_binary(n // 2)
        print(n % 2)

int_to_binary(19)
```

<details>
<summary>Pseudocode</summary>

```
PROCEDURE int_to_binary(n : INTEGER)
    IF (n = 0) OR (n = 1) THEN
        OUTPUT n
    ELSE
        CALL int_to_binary(n DIV 2)
        OUTPUT(n MOD 2)
    ENDIF
ENDPROCEDURE
```

</details>

- it converts a decimal number `n` into its binary representation using a recursive approach

| Step | n   | Operation            | Output |
| ---- | --- | -------------------- | ------ |
| 1    | 19  | Check n = 0 or n = 1 |        |
| 2    | 19  | Call X(19 DIV 2)     |        |
| 3    | 9   | Check n = 0 or n = 1 |        |
| 4    | 9   | Call X(9 DIV 2)      |        |
| 5    | 4   | Check n = 0 or n = 1 |        |
| 6    | 4   | Call X(4 DIV 2)      |        |
| 7    | 2   | Check n = 0 or n = 1 |        |
| 8    | 2   | Call X(2 DIV 2)      |        |
| 9    | 1   | Check n = 0 or n = 1 |        |
| 10   | 1   | Output n             | 1      |
| 11   | 2   | Output(n MOD 2)      | 0      |
| 12   | 4   | Output(n MOD 2)      | 0      |
| 13   | 9   | Output(n MOD 2)      | 1      |
| 14   | 19  | Output(n MOD 2)      | 1      |

## Pros and Cons of Recursion

- When addressing a mathematically recursive problem, implementing the recursive definition is often the most straightforward approach.
- Some optimizing compilers may convert a recursive subroutine to an iterative one during the compilation process.
- Recursive solutions tend to be more elegant and require less code compared to their iterative counterparts.
- However, repeated recursive calls can lead to significant memory usage and processor time, as explained in Section 24.04.
    - For instance, a procedure call like `CountDownFrom(100)` can result in 100 stack frames, 
    - impacting memory and processor resources.


### Advantages

- **Elegance:** Recursive solutions are often more concise and elegant.
- **Simplicity:** Recursive code can closely mirror the problem's mathematical definition.
- **Readability:** Recursive code can be more readable and closer to the problem statement.
- **Versatility:** Well-suited for problems with inherent recursive structures.
- **Modularity:** Promotes a modular and divide-and-conquer approach to problem-solving.

### Disadvantages

- **Memory Usage:** Recursive calls may lead to a higher memory consumption due to multiple function calls on the call stack.
- **Performance Overhead:** Recursive solutions can incur additional function call overhead.
- **Stack Overflow:** Deep recursion can lead to stack overflow errors if not properly managed.
- **Complexity:** Recursive code might be harder to understand for some programmers.
- **Not Always Efficient:** In some cases, iterative solutions may be more efficient in terms of both time and space.
