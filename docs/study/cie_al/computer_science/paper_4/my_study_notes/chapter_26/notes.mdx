Some words used here might not be exactly correct. I'm just sticking with whats in the book. classes will be further discussed in other chaptersj under OOP.

## Records


```python
# class definition
# ---------------------------------------
class CarRecord:
    def __init__(self): # constructor
        self.VehicleID = ""
        self.Registration = ""
        self.DateOfRegistration = None
        self.EngineSize = 0
        self.PurchasePrice = 0.00

# example
# ---------------------------------------
ThisCar = CarRecord()
ThisCar.EngineSize = 2500

# make a list of 100 car records
Car = [CarRecord() for i in range(100)] 
Car[1].EngineSize = 2500
```

<details>
<summary>Pseudocode</summary>

- type definition

```
TYPE CarRecord
    DECLARE VehicleID : STRING // unique identifier and record key
    DECLARE Registration : STRING
    DECLARE DateOfRegistration : DATE
    DECLARE EngineSize : INTEGER
    DECLARE PurchasePrice : CURRENCY
ENDTYPE
```

- to declare a variable of this type CarRecord

```
DECLARE ThisCar : CarRecord
```

## File Processing

- **Random file**: a file that stores records at specific addresses that can be accessed directly

- Pseudocode File Operations:

| Structured English | Pseudocode |
| - | - |
| Create a file and open it for writing OPENFILE | `<filename> FOR WRITE` |
| Open a file in append mode | `OPENFILE <filename> FOR APPEND` |
| Open a file for reading | `OPENFILE <filename> FOR READ` |
| Open a file for random access | `OPENFILE <filename> FOR RANDOM` |
| Close a file | `CLOSEFILE <filename>` |
| Write a record to a file | `PUTRECORD <filename>, <identifier>` |
| Read a record from a file | `GETRECORD <filename>, <identifier>` |
| Move to a specific disk address within the file | `SEEK <filename>, <address>` |
| Test for end of file | `EOF(<filename>)` |

- Note that there are two new operations:

| Structured English | Pseudocode |
| - | - |
| Write a record to a file | `PUTRECORD <filename>, <identifier>` |
| Read a record from a file | `GETRECORD <filename>, <identifier>` |

- These can be used to directly store records (objects in our memmory) to a file (serialized)
- When needed, we can directly load that object to the memmory with pickles
- the `.pkl` or `.dat` file that stores this object is meaning less unless its loaded into memmory using the python's `pickle` module

#### Now, please refer to the [Pickles note](pickles) before continuing forward and come back

### Sequential File Processing

- If we have an array of records, we may want to store the records on disk before the program quits, so that we don't lose the data. 
- We can open a binary file and write one record after another to the file. 
- We can then read the records back into the array when the program is run again.

- Python:

```python
import pickle

Car = [CarRecord() for i in range(100)]

with open('CarFile.DAT', 'wb') as file:
    for i in range(100):
        pickle.dump(Car[i], file) # write a whole record to the binary file

Car = []
with open('CarFile.DAT', 'rb') as file:
    while True: # check for end of file
        Car.append(pickle.load(file)) # append record from file to end of list
```

<details>
<summary>Pseudocode</summary>

- Saving contents of array 

```
OPENFILE CarFile FOR WRITE
FOR i ← 1 TO MaxRecords
    PUTRECORD CarFile, Car[i]
NEXT i
CLOSEFILE CarFile 
```

- Restoring contents of array

```
OPENFILE CarFile FOR READ
FOR i ← 1 TO MaxRecords
    GETRECORD CarFile, Car[i]
NEXT i
CLOSEFILE CarFile 
```

</details>

### Random-access file processing

- Python:

```python
import pickle

class CarRecord:
    def __init__(self, VehicleID):
        self.VehicleID = VehicleID

# Writing a record to the file
ThisCar = CarRecord(VehicleID='12345') 
Address = hash(ThisCar.VehicleID)

with open('CarFile.DAT', 'rb+') as CarFile: # rb+ - can append
    CarFile.seek(Address)
    pickle.dump(ThisCar, CarFile)


# Reading a record from the file
VehicleID_to_find = '12345' 

with open('CarFile.DAT', 'rb') as CarFile:
    Address = hash(VehicleID_to_find)
    CarFile.seek(Address)    
    ThisCar = pickle.load(CarFile)

# Print the loaded record
print(f"Loaded Record: VehicleID - {ThisCar.VehicleID}")
```

- To retrieve a record based on a given VehicleID, 
    - the file is opened in read mode (`rb`). 
    - The file pointer is moved to the calculated address using seek, 
    - and then pickle.load is used to deserialize (load) the record from the file.

<details>

- Saving a record

```
OPENFILE CarFile FOR RANDOM
Address ← Hash(ThisCar.VehicleID)
SEEK CarFile, Address
PUTRECORD CarFile, ThisCar
CLOSEFILE CarFile
```

- Retrieving a record

```
OPENFILE CarFile FOR RANDOM
Address ← Hash(ThisCar.VehicleID)
SEEK CarFile, Address
PUTRECORD CarFile, ThisCar
CLOSEFILE CarFile 
```

## Exception Handling

- essential for writing robust and error-tolerant code. 
- allows developers to gracefully handle unexpected errors and prevent program crashes

- **Try-Except Block:**
   - Syntax:
    ```python
    try:
        # Code that might raise an exception
        # ...
    except SomeSpecificException as e:
        # Handle specific exception
        # ...
    except AnotherSpecificException as e:
        # Handle another specific exception
        # ...
    except Exception as e:
        # Handle generic exception
        # ...
    else:
        # Executed if no exception occurs in the try block
        # ...
    finally:
        # Always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not
        # ...
     ```

   - Example:
    ```python
    try:
        # Code that might raise an exception
        result = 10 / 0
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        # Handling a specific exception
        print("Error: Cannot divide by zero!")
    except Exception as e:
        # Handling a generic exception
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
    else:
        # Executed if no exception occurs in the try block
        print("No errors!")
    finally:
        # Always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not
        print("Finally block executed.")
     ```

- **Common Exception Types:**
    - `IOError`: for example, a file cannot be opened
    - `ImportError`: Python cannot find the module
    - `ValueError`: an argument has an inappropriate value
    - `KeyboardInterrupt`: the user presses Ctrl+C or Ctrl+Del
    - `EOFError`: a file-read meets an end-of-file condition
    - `ZeroDivisionError`: a division by zero has been attempted

- **Finally Block:**
   - The `finally` block is optional and is used for code that must be executed regardless of whether an exception occurred.

   - Example:
     ```python
     try:
         # Code that may raise an exception
     except ExceptionType as e:
         # Code to handle the exception
     finally:
         # Code that always runs, regardless of exceptions
     ```

- **Custom Exceptions:**
   - Developers can create custom exception classes by inheriting from the `Exception` class.

   - Example:
     ```python
     class CustomError(Exception):
         def __init__(self, message):
             self.message = message

     try:
         raise CustomError("This is a custom exception")
     except CustomError as e:
         print("Custom Error:", e.message)
     ```
