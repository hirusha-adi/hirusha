## Introduction

### Benefits

- easier to manage/plan
- easier to estimate costs

### What do arrows mean?

- **Downward arrows:** Results input to the next stage
- **Upward arrows:** More work often needed at earlier stages


## The program development life cycle

- Development life cycle stages: *analysis, design, coding, testing, maintenance*
- Maintenance leads to program fitness
- Cycle starts anew when maintenance is insufficient.

## Waterfall Model


- **Downward arrows**: results from one stage is passed to the next
- **Upward arrows**: more work is required at previous stage to complete the current stage

### Advantages

- Simple to understand
- Easy to manage
- Sequential stages
- Suitable for well-understood small projects

### Disadvantages

- Late working software (No early prototypes)
- difficult to cope with changes to requirements
- needs high involvement of customer/client

or

- Not suitable for complex, object-oriented, or long projects
- Inflexible to changing requirements
- Progress measurement difficulty
- Late integration, issues identification.

## Iterative Model

- No full requirement specification at the start
- Begin with a small subset of requirements
- Repeated reviews for further requirements
- Gradual development toward a complete system

### Advantages

- Early working model
- Easier issue identification
- Quick development of functionality
- Early and periodic results
- Parallel development possible
- Measurable progress
- Cost-effective scope changes
- Easier testing and debugging
- Risk management
- Incremental delivery
- Continuous improvement
- Suitable for large projects
- Customer evaluation and feedback.

### Disadvantages

- Limited benefit for small projects
- More resources needed
- Potential design issues
- Complete system definition for increments.

##  Rapid Application Development (RAD)


- Modules developed in **parallel** as **prototypes**
- more flexible development process

### Advantages

- quicker development possible
- prototype produced at early stage
- easier to change requirements
- early review possible

### Disadvantages

- diffifcult to estimate cost / time to complete
- documentation is limited
- lack of client availability through life cycle
