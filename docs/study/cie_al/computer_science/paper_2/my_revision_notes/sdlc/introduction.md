## First Steps

### Abstraction

- removing unwanted information from the problem to solve
- keeping only required information

#### Benefits:

- the solution is simplified
- its quicker to run
- the system is tailored to users needs

### Decomposition

- breaking problems to sub problems
- to understand and solve it easily
- smaller problems are easier to program/test
- concept of program modules
- different teams can code different modules simultaneously (+ developers with a different skillset)

### Data modelling (Never Asked Before)

- analyzing and organizing data using Abstract Data Types, custom data types, etc..

### Pattern recognition (Never Asked Before)

- Look for patterns or common solutions
- reduces repeated code

### Algorithm design (Never Asked Before)

- a sequence of defined steps that can be carried out to perform a task
