## Preventing Errors

- Minimize errors
- bad requirement analysis
- Understanding problem + user needs
- Using structured programming, OOP design
- follow Conventions
- Using modules from program libraries

## How to identify Errors?

- dry run it
- add output statements within the code to track the status
- insert breakpoints to the program
- or use single stepping
- while using the report window to monitor variables
- and find where the code fails 

### Incorrect Code

- incorrect block structure
- data type errors
    - eg: assign integer to string
- identifier used before its declareds
- incorrect paramater use

### Incorrect Operations
	
- INTEGER + STRING
- INTEGER & STRING
- INTEGER < STRING (>,<,<=, >=)

### What is a Breakpoint?

- the program will halt executing when it reaches a specific instruction

## Syntax Errors

- error in which a program statement does not follow the rules of the language

### No syntax errors means

- obeys rules of programming languages
- the program will run
- eg: no mispelt keywords

## Runtime Error

- error that causes program execution to crash or freeze
- program performes invalid operations
- eg: 
    - divide by zero / `ZeroDivisionError`
    - `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsError`


## Logic Error

- error in the logic of the solution that causes it not to behave as intended
