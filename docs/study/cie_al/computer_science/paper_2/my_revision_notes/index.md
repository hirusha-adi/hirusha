I've got my notes right here! I made these in the 5 days leading up to the exam. I think if you can remember all of these, you'll be able to nail the majority (or even all) of the theory questions on Paper 2. I mainly used Marking Schemes to make these notes (from all 9618 Paper 2's upto 2023 June Series), so they're really focused on what you need for the exam. But keep in mind, these notes are more for revising what you've already learned, so they might not be the best place to start if you haven't covered the syllabus yet. (This is best for a Revision Note)
