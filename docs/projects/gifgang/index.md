## What is this?

Simply

- A website with Images and GIFs, A discord bot, a python module to be used by other developers

Detailed

- This is a website with both SFW and NSFW GIF's and Images (Some redirecting to Videos in thier original website). This website does NOT own any media displayed. All the media are taken/requested/scraped from many services and the service name is mentioned above every image set to give credit. ( You can call this a lightweight yet modern and powerful wrapper for many websites with media. ). We also provide a discord bot and a python module for other developers

## Description (2023) 

This is a very special project to it. I built when i was 15 years old. This is my very first sort-of full stack web application and my very first time using MongoDB and also my very time getting my hands diry with nginx. I learnt a lot while creating it. The code is not perfect and has a large of amount of bugs. Most of the user interfaces where taken from codepen.io (i have mentioned them in the src code accordingly, in the required places) as i had no proper css knowledge, therefore, the site looks very inconsistent.

Now that i look at it, that code looks like a joke + i wish i have used SQL for it.

Original idea was by NoPE

Others who supported this project: Oshada, Chinthana

This was hosted on [gifgang.net](https://gifgang.net) back then (it doesn't work anymore).
