Culture is the collective manifestation of knowledge, beliefs, customs, arts, laws, and practices shared by a group of people and it influences every aspect of life, from language, food, and clothing to values, traditions, and societal structures. Culture is mostly inherited from the previous generations of an individual.

Just as culture is a great and integral part of our lives, in this article, we will be discussing some aspects that challenge cultural norms. 

Many of you may find these views controversial, but they are grounded in rationality rather than cultural beliefs.

## Examples

### Example 1

In Sri Lanka, there's a widely held belief that if an individual sees something bad or encounters someone with a negative vibe early in the morning, it signals that the entire day will go wrong. Surprisingly, this belief often seems to come true, leading many to wonder why this happens.

When someone starts their day by seeing something they perceive as bad, it immediately triggers the thought that the rest of the day will be doomed. This idea takes root in their mind, lingering throughout the day and subtly influencing their actions and decisions. As the individual goes about their daily routine, this negative expectation acts like a self-fulfilling prophecy. 

With their mind already set on the notion that the day will turn out badly, they may become more prone to stress, anxiety, or irritation, affecting their judgment and behavior. This heightened negativity can lead to poor decision-making, whether it's snapping at a colleague, overlooking important details, or simply not being as productive. These seemingly small mistakes accumulate, reinforcing the initial belief that the day is bad.

Moreover, this psychological effect is often compounded by confirmation bias, where the individual unconsciously looks for signs that support their belief. If something minor goes wrong, it becomes "proof" that the day is indeed cursed, even if other aspects of the day go well. This selective focus on the negative further amplifies the feeling that the entire day is ruined.

In essence, the belief that seeing something bad in the morning will lead to a bad day creates a mental framework that guides the individual's thoughts and actions in a way that almost guarantees the prediction comes true. The power of the mind, combined with cultural conditioning, makes what could have been just an ordinary day turn into one filled with challenges and negativity.

### Example 2

### Example 3

In various cultures, encountering a black cat is believed to be an ill omen, signaling bad luck or misfortune. Much like the situation described in [Example 1](#example-1), this belief can lead to a similar psychological effect.

When someone encounters a black cat and associates it with bad luck, this belief can deeply impact their mindset. The individual may start anticipating problems or setbacks, leading them to act in ways that inadvertently contribute to negative outcomes. The expectation of misfortune can heighten their anxiety and alertness to potential issues, often resulting in a focus on negative aspects rather than solutions.

This heightened sense of dread can cause the person to make poor decisions or miss opportunities, which then reinforces their belief that the black cat was indeed a bad omen. Much like the situation in [Example 1](#example-1), this creates a cycle where the initial superstition influences behavior in a way that makes the predicted negative outcomes more likely.

### Example 3

In Sri Lanka, there's a belief that hearing a gecko's sound just as someone is about to start something positive is a bad omen, signaling that the task will likely fail or go awry. Surprisingly, many people find that their experiences align with this belief, raising questions about its validity.

Once again, it's similar to what's mentioned in [Example 1](#example-1) and [Example 2](#example-2).

### Example 4

In the Philippines, there is a belief that dreaming about cutting one's hair is a bad omen, symbolizing the loss of a loved one. Hair is seen as something that holds a great deal of memories, and cutting it in a dream is thought to represent severing ties with someone important in real life. This belief can have a profound psychological impact on those who take it seriously.

When an individual dreams of cutting their hair and believes in this superstition, the idea that they will soon lose someone close to them can take root in their mind. This fear and anticipation can weigh heavily on their thoughts, influencing their emotions and actions in subtle ways.

As the individual goes about their daily life, the belief that they are destined to lose a loved one may cause them to act differently without even realizing it. They might become more distant, withdrawn, or overly cautious in their relationships, which could strain connections with those they care about. This shift in behavior might inadvertently create situations that lead to misunderstandings or conflicts, further distancing them from the people they love.

The individual’s heightened anxiety and preoccupation with the idea of loss can also make them more sensitive to normal life events, interpreting them as signs that the dream's prophecy is coming true. For example, a minor argument or a loved one’s brief absence might be perceived as the beginning of a deeper rift or loss.

In this way, the belief in the dream’s omen becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. The individual’s subconscious actions, driven by the fear instilled by the dream, can lead to outcomes that seem to validate the superstition. The psychological effect is powerful, demonstrating how a deeply held absurd belief, even one rooted in mythology, can shape reality in unexpected ways. What was originally an irrational fear born from a dream can evolve into real-life consequences, all due to the influence of the mind on behavior and relationships.

### Example 5

NO! I’m going to stop this here. This list could go on forever.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, these occurrences are driven entirely by psychological effects, specifically the concept of the self-fulfilling prophecy. A self-fulfilling prophecy occurs when a person's belief or expectation influences their actions in a way that causes the belief or expectation to come true.

Those who believe in these myths are most affected, as their minds are conditioned to anticipate negative outcomes, which then leads to behaviors that confirm their fears.

Even those who do not fully believe in these superstitions might still experience some influence, as the mere knowledge of such beliefs can subtly impact their thoughts and actions. 

However, those who are unaware of these absurd mythological beliefs are safe from the dangers they pose. 

An individual who approaches life rationally will not develop such irrational fears on their own, remaining unaffected unless these absurd cultural believes are introduced to them by others.

Stay away from absurd cultural beliefs and act and think rationally.
