## Guide

### Topic 1

1. Remember that area underneath the velocity-time graph is displacement

2. Base units are [s:seconds (time), m:meters (distance), kg:kilogram (mass)]

3. for equations for motion:
remember to always write all of the quantities that are available so you know what equation to use

s = 

u = 

v = 

a = 

t =

To resolve *horizontally U(x) = Ucos(theta)* 

To resolve *vertically U(y) = Usin(theta)*

remember that *a = -g when we are resolving vertically*

*when we dont have (a)* then you use s = (u+v) x t/2

*when we dont have (s)* then you use v = u + at

*when we dont have (v)* then you use s = ut + 0.5at^2

*when we dont have (t)* then you use v^2 = u^2 + 2as

4. Know that magnitude of two vectors is sqrt(a^2 + b^2), eg if u = 5m/s and another u = 8m/s

```
              *u = 8m/s*
-----------------------------------------
-                                                         -
-                                               - 
-                                     -       magnitude: sqrt(6^2 + 8^2)                            
- *u=6m/s*   -                                     = sqrt ( 36 + 64 )
-             -                                                  =  sqrt( 100 )
-                                                                 = *10m/s*
```

5.  When you are confused in projectiles calculations, draw a diagram and write down what the question gives us and look at it two or three times so you can see another way of starting the question

6. Remember that in Pulse/echo questions, usually people forget to times the distance given by two because for the echo to exist, the sounds particle must travel to and back from where it reflects back.

16. What is the optimum size to get maximum diffraction ? (refer to λ and gap size in your answer)

17. When do we get maximum and minimum patterns forming in the double slit experiment (refer to nλ and (2n + 1)λ/2 in your answer as well as dark fringes) you can also use the equation nλ=dsinθ to help explain

35. What does threshold frequency refer to ?

37. Remember the equation hf = Φ + 1/2 mv2max 

38. Remember that the de Broglie equation is referring to electrons (λ = h/p) we can also remember that p = mv so we can rewrite the de Broglie equation as λ=h/mv

39. Define ground state ( remember to use the term lowest energy level)

40. What happens when electrons take in energy ? (Use the term excitation in your answer), what happens as a result of electrons being excited ?

41. Are energy levels discrete or not ?

42. What happens when electrons relax and jump down energy levels ? (Remember to state that the photons (because now they are particles not waves and they emit a wavelength which then results in atomic spectra)

43. Recall that longer wavelengths: [red] ————————> shorter wavelength [purple]

44. Remember that ∆E = E2 -  E1 where E2 is the higher Energy level and E1 is the Ground state 

45. Recall that I = P/A where P is Power and A is the Area

11. Draw the V/I Graph on filament lamp, Diode, Thermistor, Ohmic resistor (the one in the book is I/V not V/I, in the exam they usually ask for V/I graph not I/V)

12. Define resistivity, What factors affect resistance (I.e resistivity, length, Area) E.g If Wire 1 has a large area, will it have a higher resistance or less than a wire with smaller area and why ?

Refer to the formula as well if stuck R = pl/A

13. Define drift velocity 

14. What are conductor electrons ? 

15. In the equation I= nqvA, (questions from this equation are usually straight forward, just remember that q = charge on the carrier)

16. What is the difference between a full valence band vs semi full valence band and what does it mean for the conductibity ?

17. Name some semiconductors and why are they called semiconductors ?

18. Remember LURD and TURD:
            Lights UP, Resistance DOWN
            Temperature UP, Resistance DOWN

27. Recall that Efficiency = P(out)/P(in)  

28. Remember that unit conversions usually come up for MCQ, so remember the standard units so you don’t get confused 


#### General comments for Unit 2:

Remember to mind the time, the paper comparatively is easier to Unit 1 but is very long and is usually focussed on a lot of Topic 3 questions as Topic 3 has more theory and concepts, I would be vary of photoelectric effect, diffraction grating, typical questions will range from : finding resistivity, using power of a system to get efficiency, Circuits questions [parallel, potentiometer, LDR, parallel resistance, drawing circuits], finding critical angle, using echo/pulse concept to work out time for an echo, converting units, definitions of terms, polarising filters and how they work. 
Remember to write the formula if stuck, it may help remember the topic at hand
You HAVE to state the obvious in long answer questions because the mark scheme is picky and they give you stand alone marks for just stating certain facts 
Lastly, make sure you have enough time to go over your paper properly at least once or twice.

Error vs Uncertainty

Key Ideas:

Error:
* Error is something that can be dealt with
* Error is something that can be eliminated and that is usually the fault of the experimenter or something within that
* It is difference between the measurement result and the true value if a true value is thought to exist

Uncertainty:
* Something that is inherent in the experiment
* It can’t be eliminated, only characterized and possibly reduced with better equipment
* Characterized means measured how big it is

Measurement/Instrumental UNCERTAINTY — Minimisable:

- It has various other names like “Reading Error” or “Instrumental Error”
- Both these are misnomers as this is NOT an ERROR 
- There is going to be some minimum division by which the instrument will not read more accurately then
- Minimize the reading uncertainty by making conditions 

Systematic ERROR — Can be Eliminated:
- Error that is built-in to the experiment systematically and can in fact be removed
- For example a damaged or worn meter stick with its short edge being worn
- Another form of systematic error is reading top of meniscus
- Keep in mind, sometimes it can be slightly tricky to completely eliminate it sometimes.

Random ERROR (or Uncertainty*):

- An error caused by unpredictable variations in conditions
- For e.g., it is nearly impossible to read a meniscus at the exact same angle and under the exact same conditions
- This error can be due to both systematic and random effects and an error of unknown size is a source of [random] uncertainty
