### Remember

#### Key things to do when doing past papers: 

1. How long am I taking for the paper ? (aim to finish atleast 20 minutes before the actual time)

2. Do I know how to start the question ? If I don't, then what chapter is this question about as well why can't i start it ?

3. Will I do exactly what the marksheme is doing ? if not then why ?

4. Was i fully focussed on the paper and applying exam condition ? if not then why not ?
