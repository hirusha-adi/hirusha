Whether you are setting up a computer for yourself or someone else, it's always better to have the user's files on a separate disk (or at least a partition) for easy recovery and management. Doing this also allows directories (like Desktop) to be shared among multiple operating systems if you dual boot.  

Above all, this helps you easily recover or retain your files even if you break your operating system. This is my case - I distro hop every now and then or do a fresh install after breaking something. So, it's easier for me to have everything set up on a separate disk, with proper organization, to switch between them seamlessly. Moreover, I dual boot, so, for instance, this allows me to share the same Desktop and Downloads folders across different operating systems.
