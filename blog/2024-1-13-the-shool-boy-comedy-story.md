## Introduction

Once upon a time in a struggling, third-world country, there lived a schoolboy named Brian. His humble home was situated about 50 kilometers away from the school he attended. Each morning, Brian embarked on a one-hour journey to school in a crowded school van.

The early hours found Brian rising with the sun, preparing for his daily trek. By 6:15 am, he would hop onto the school van, and after navigating the dusty roads, he'd reach his destination around 7:30 am.

Despite the fact that Brian's school was a private international institution, the students seldom conversed in English. However, their grammar skills surpassed those of their peers in public schools. Brian found joy in his preschool days and continued to relish his time in Grade 1, 2, and 3.

In addition to his academic pursuits, Brian harbored a passion for playing chess. Though not a good player by any means, he found genuine enjoyment in the strategic game.

## How it all started

In Grade 2, Brian discovered the mobile game "Shadow Fight 2" on his mother's phone and enjoyed playing it. In the middle of Grade 3, he faced difficulties passing a level, leading him to search for solutions on the internet. This introduced him to the world of game modding.

Brian found Facebook and Vkontakte groups where players like him were attempting to mod the same game. Subsequently, he created his first Facebook and Vkontakte accounts to join these groups. Driven by his interest in technology, he quickly caught up with modding this game.

By Grade 3, Brian requested a phone from his parents, receiving an HTC-526-G+ with Android KitKat. He rooted his phone and actively explored modding the game, becoming an engaged member of the modding community. During this time, he also initiated his own YouTube channel to share videos of his heavily modded gameplay.

## The early change

In Grade 4, Brian got tired of using mods made by others, so he decided to learn how to make his own. He self-studied the installation directory of the game in his phone's file system, finding several .xml configuration files. Through trial and error, he figured out how to create unique armors, weapons, helmets, and even design his own opponents and maps for the game. To achieve this, he learned Photoshop to edit and manipulate the texture files. His mods gained recognition, and he became a well-known member of the Shadow Fight 2 game modding community.

In Grade 4, Brian served as a Junior Prefect. However, during this period, his interest in most school subjects waned, and he focused solely on technology, programming, math, and biology. Subjects like Buddhism, History, Geography, General Knowledge, Sinhala, etc., held no appeal for him, leading to low marks in the school's first term test.

## A bad teacher

In Grade 4, Brian experienced harassment from his class teacher, a woman in her mid-20s named Baluruddihika (බලුරුද්දීකා).

- He was treated very differently in class,
- and the teacher would approach him in the morning, touching his hands and remarking that they were "too soft for a boy." As a result, Brian was singled out for unusual tasks like sweeping the classroom daily, and on one occasion, he even swept half of the school's front yard once, all because of his teacher's perception of his hands. This treatment stood out from the norm, as other students cleaned their classrooms only on assigned "Cleaning days." - Extremely ludicrous!
- Brian faced mockery in front of the entire class for wearing his school trousers on his hips, just the way that all boys did.
- Brian had a habit of biting his nails since early childhood. His class teacher checked his nails three or four times a month, resorting to physically hitting his bitten fingers nails with a ruler. (just try to imagine how much this should have hurt) Whether this practice served any positive purpose is uncertain. Despite the intervention, Brian still struggled to overcome this habit.

Throughout Grade 4, Brian consistently faced mistreatment from his teacher, Baluruddihika (බලුරුද්දීකා). The reasons for this treatment appeared to be personal and unjustified, as Brian experienced continuous harassment without any apparent cause.

Brian, a 10-year-old, experiencing emotional distress from the unwarranted drama, attempted to skip school and stay home whenever possible throughout the year.

## Middle School

Brian, now 11 years old and in Grade 5, found himself in a new classroom located approximately 2 kilometers away from his previous primary school, situated across town. The school van transporting him occasionally arrived late, around 7:35 am, while school officially started at 7:30 am. Punishments for arriving late were primarily imposed on students in Grade 7/8 and above, while the Grade 5 students were typically exempt from such consequences.

In the new school building complex, there was a canteen that Brian and his friend loved to visit. However, the teachers imposed a rule prohibiting Grade 5 students from using the canteen, even on days when it might have been necessary.

On occasions when Brian couldn't bring food to school, he had to go to the nearest food store, located about 200-500 meters away from school. After purchasing food, he would return to school, inevitably arriving late and having to explain the delay, despite the restrictions on Grade 5 students accessing the canteen.

## A new beginning

While in Grade 5, Brian, intrigued by the announcement of the latest Android Lollipop release, eagerly checked for updates on his phone without success. Undeterred, he decided to explore flashing a custom ROM to his device by following online guides. Despite limited knowledge on the topic as an enthusiastic 11-year-old, Brian downloaded an Android Lollipop ROM, unlocked the bootloader of his rooted phone, and attempted to flash the custom ROM. Unfortunately, the process failed and resulted in breaking his phone. After days of searching for the cause of the failure, Brian discovered that he had downloaded an Android Lollipop ROM intended for another architecture.

After rendering his phone unusable with the failed attempt to flash a custom ROM, Brian spent the following weeks on his computer. During this time, he found enjoyment in playing GTA-SA, utilizing his modding skills to enhance the gaming experience by creating new maps within weeks. However, after about a month, Brian grew bored of playing games. He wanted to create something of his own.

Stumbling upon a YouTube channel that taught the Swing framework in Java, Brian, with limited knowledge of computer programming, began following the Java tutorials. He successfully mastered the basics of the programming language, including conditionals and loops. However, lacking a proper mentor, he struggled to grasp Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts at his age.

Despite the challenges, Brian managed to create his first GUI calculator app using the NetBeans IDE. He also developed some basic login forms. Looking back, Brian acknowledges that the quality of his early code was low due to a lack of understanding in effectively applying OOP concepts in Java.

## Late middle school and high school

Brian made the decision to prioritize computer programming over studying ancient civilizations taught at school. During lunch breaks, he frequented the school library to read books related to computers. However, the limited time available during these breaks restricted Brian's ability to deeply comprehend the material.

Despite his passion for computer programming, Brian's school grades were not stellar. He scored good marks in subjects like Maths and ICT, but he was not the best at other subjects.

When the school term tests approached, Brian temporarily paused his programming endeavors to focus on exam preparation. This shift in focus meant sacrificing about 9-12 weeks of time that could have been spent enhancing his skills and delving deeper into computer-related knowledge and technology.

At the end of Grade 5, Brian began learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and some basic vanilla JS.

By the end of Grade 6 in 2018, he discovered GitHub to manage his code and created his first GitHub account.

During the end of Grade 7, Brian encountered Python, a versatile programming language that he embraced for many of his projects due to its efficiency and minimal boilerplate code compared to languages like Java.

Advancing to Grade 9 in 2021, Brian served as a prefect. The COVID-19 outbreak led to the shift to online classes, where students struggled to focus due to trolls disrupting the sessions. The school's slow response resulted in approximately a year of interruptions before transitioning to Microsoft Teams from free Google Meet meetings.

In the initial months of 2021, all activities shifted online. Brian, with experience in editing and creating texture files for Shadow Fight 2, was approached by the prefects board to create posters/images. Annoyed, Brian spent several days making over 40+ images for them, with 15+ crafted in just a week for a Vesak Lantern Competition. This time-consuming task, perceived as useless by Brian, took away precious hours that he could have otherwise spent learning and exploring his interests.

## School after covid

Brian, after enhancing his knowledge during the COVID-19 period while staying at home, revisited the school library when in-person classes resumed after 2021. He sought out the same books he had previously read to gauge his improved understanding. This proved to be a joyful and memorable moment for Brian, as he discovered that he now comprehended those materials better.

One of the notable books Brian revisited was a large old CCNA study guide by Cisco. This book, with its beautifully explained OSI model, presented advanced concepts in an easily understandable manner, contributing significantly to Brian's improved understanding of the subject.

## "Firday Program"

In Brian's school, there was a Friday program where muslim students attended the mosque around 12:30 pm. Meanwhile, students of other religions were left at school with seemingly nothing useful to do. On some occasions, students were compelled to make sandwiches in the classroom. Despite the presence of valuable books in the school library, Brian found himself stuck inside the classroom during these times as per his teachers' instructions. This routine proved to be the worst time waste for Brian, and it occurred every Friday. Activities during this period ranged from listening to religious sermons from a monk to engaging in exercises or simply reading the books available in the class.

Brian, opting to pursue subjects of his interest rather than ancient civilizations and religious stories, attempted to escape the classroom during a Friday program where others were forced to study these subjects alone under teacher supervision. While en route to the library, Brian was caught midway and faced punishment, kneeling for several minutes before being returned to the class. Despite his efforts, he ended up spending the next 1.5 hours in the classroom doing nothing.

Brian views the enforced restrictions on students during the Friday program, especially when wanting to go to the library and read a book of their choice, as the worst way to waste time in school. He questions the purpose of such constraints, wondering what the teachers aim to achieve, as it appears to be an unproductive measure from the perspective of a student.

## "The Exit Pass" & Washroom

In Brian's school, students needed an exit pass from a teacher to be outside the classroom without supervision, even for basic tasks like going to the washroom. Obtaining this pass required seeking permission from the teacher in charge at that moment. However, the ease of obtaining the pass often depended on the particular teacher, such as Mr. Payanka (පයංක). If he was in charge, students might face difficulties getting the exit pass, potentially resulting in delays of an hour or more before being allowed to leave the class.

:::note but why?

The restriction on students needing permission to leave the classroom, even for basic needs like going to the washroom, can have health implications.

_"In some cases, holding in pee for too long can cause bacteria to multiply. This may lead to a urinary tract infection (UTI). Many doctors recommend avoiding holding in pee for extended periods of time, as it can increase the risk of UTIs."_ - [Medical News Today](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/321408#:~:text=In%20some%20cases%2C%20holding%20in,a%20history%20of%20frequent%20UTIs.)

Possible side effects:
