:::danger WARNING

This article is entirely based on my personal experiences and reflects my personal opinion.

:::

:::info NOTE

Everything, including the food prepared for the monks, is done with great care and cleanliness. This is truly commendable.

:::


The Buddhist devotees only assist by cutting vegetables and preparing food for the chef, but you might wonder why this matters. Well, it's because they ensure that the food is cooked without artificial flavors and additives like Knorr stock cubes or [MSG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5938543/), which can be harmful but are commonly used by many Sri Lankans.

However, this commitment to cleanliness takes a turn for the worse when it comes to the basic needs of Buddhist devotees who assist in cutting vegetables and preparing food for the chefs all night long.

## Sleeping Rooms

![i0](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1163847683207856178/1169636332692308018/IMG-20231102-WA0025.jpg?ex=65561fb8&is=6543aab8&hm=8c710d4b361638c3965960b398e41b9039ba53e57185f8164e1e61c0f4e34bfa&)

- If you're older or find it hard to climb stairs, you might face difficulty in finding a place to sleep. There is a space available for such individuals, but it can only accommodate two people at max.

![i1](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1163847683207856178/1169636353663827998/IMG-20231102-WA0026.jpg?ex=65561fbd&is=6543aabd&hm=527e6314e81329b48533522832581e7c4345366e33041821d29fe8b87fb9255d&)

- In the larger room, there is a single bed available, while the smaller room lacks any beds, requiring visitors to place a mat on the floor for sleeping, nothing comfortable, though it's worth noting that the sleeping areas often have a noticeable presence of mosquitoes and other insects, which can be quite bothersome.

![i2](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1163847683207856178/1169636421653504181/IMG-20231102-WA0028.jpg?ex=65561fcd&is=6543aacd&hm=80c13d0241455119bd70d7da0f55a8aa8dbaeaecab329292e68d6b65c7111d9f&)

- There isn't a designated area for changing your clothes, so you might need to step into a space within the washroom area for that purpose.

![i3](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1163847683207856178/1169636437822541875/IMG-20231102-WA0029.jpg?ex=65561fd1&is=6543aad1&hm=1ab21129dd49fa7a1afe123fa3f18882adb7575249bb7b98abb4f0bf410156b1&)

## Washrooms

- This is the location where you can find the washrooms.

- Let's take a closer look at the washrooms, shall we?

## Bathing Area

- This is the designated area where you are supposed to wash yourself.

![i7](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1163847683207856178/1169646400129224714/IMG-20231102-WA0033.jpg?ex=65562918&is=6543b418&hm=fb1667773d5a717d5edbfcb9c88ca8a66f99993172b699904ee092520c1a3059&)

- It was too disgusting and repulsive to approach any closer.

![i8](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1163847683207856178/1169647025600598016/IMG-20231102-WA0036.jpg?ex=655629ad&is=6543b4ad&hm=2a77c2d7cb7c4255d9df8e64616a4f95480164fba13d19450c08497735f2dee4&)

## Flies

- The three images below illustrate the location where shoes are taken off, which happens to be close to the area where food is served, and they also depict the significant presence of flies that are drawn to these shoes.

![i9](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1163847683207856178/1169650507321716766/IMG-20231102-WA0054.jpg?ex=65562cec&is=6543b7ec&hm=82d592a6ab34c3889037c9dcd0f50cc952c1d664530edd5057b874fd8acb2072&)

- The images below reveal how these flies can end up on the food that the Buddhist devotees who dedicated their night to preparing it are expected to consume, and feel free to zoom in on the images to count the number of flies present on the food; it's important to note that when I approached the food items with my camera, a majority of the flies flew away, yet the remaining presence of flies remains quite concerning.

### Feacal-oral transmission

![a1](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0048969720324360-gr1.jpg)

Feacal-oral transmission of harmful bacteria like H. pylori and other common pathogens typically occurs when microscopic particles of fecal matter containing these bacteria come into contact with our mouth or are ingested through contaminated food or water. Flies can play a role in spreading these bacteria through a process known as mechanical transmission.

Flies are known to be vectors for various bacteria, as they can land on and feed on a variety of substances, including feces, sewage, decaying organic matter, and even garbage. When flies come into contact with these sources, they can pick up bacteria, including H. pylori and other pathogens, on their bodies and mouthparts. If flies then land on uncovered food or surfaces that come into contact with food, they can transfer these bacteria, potentially leading to contamination.

When people consume food that has been contaminated by flies carrying harmful bacteria, they can unknowingly introduce these pathogens into their digestive system. If proper food handling and hygiene practices are not maintained, it can increase the risk of infection. 

To reduce the risk of fecal-oral transmission of harmful bacteria, it's essential to practice good hygiene, especially in food preparation and handling. This includes washing hands thoroughly with soap and water, maintaining clean and sanitary food storage and preparation areas, and protecting food from fly and insect contamination, such as by using food covers or keeping food covered when not in use. Proper cooking and thorough washing of fruits and vegetables can also help reduce the risk of bacterial infections.
