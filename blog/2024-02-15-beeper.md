:::warning NOTE

This is completely my personal opinion.

I was trying to find a good client for whatsapp for Linux and that's when I came acress [Beeper (All your chats in one app. Yes, really.)](https://www.beeper.com/), but it is still not released publicly and you will have to join the waitlist to use it. After some digging around in the [r/beeper](https://www.reddit.com/r/beeper/) subreddit, I was able to find a working redeem key in this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/beeper/comments/18ep74x/beeper_cloud_referrals_thread/). 

## What is Beeper?

This app allows you combine all of your messaging apps into place. You can login in to each an every platform provided by Beeper and manage all of your chats within one application easily. You can also use iMessage on Android (and even on Windows Computers) after some setup, I don't have any comments about it since I'm completely on the Android ecosystem.

Watch this video to understand how the iMessage thing works:

According to his video, it seems pretty reliable and secure as no intermediate relay is being used.

For me, what's interesting in it is combining all of my third party messaging apps and using all of them in one application.

## How Beeper Cloud works?

From this section onwards, i'll be referring to "Beeper Cloud" when i say "Beeper".

It's fairly simple. We have the proprietary client application (I guess it's fine) and an [open source backend](https://github.com/beeper). Beeper is built upon Matrix. Matrix Bridges to be specific. "Bridges allow you to connect Matrix to a third-party platform, and interact seamlessly" ([Click here](https://matrix.org/ecosystem/bridges/) to learn more). Beeper basically helps you to easily to use these community hosted matrix bridges and the matrix bridges maintained by Beeper themselves using their propriertary client application.

## Security Concerns

### Bridges

"The bridge can optionally encrypt messages between Matrix users and the bridge to hide messages from the homeserver." - Source: [Official mautrix-bridges documentation](https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/general/end-to-bridge-encryption.html)

Are these matrix bridges encrypted?

Matrix servers are decentralized and mostly anonymous, so, even if they wanted to grab your data, they'll have a hard time doing so.

But of course, you can [self host it](https://github.com/beeper/bridge-manager) if you do not trust them with your data, it's well documented and it should be fairly easy.

"for complete control over your data on Beeper, you always have the option of self hosting the 'bridge' component on your own computer or server" - by [the CEO of Beeper](https://www.reddit.com/r/beeper/comments/14nmt5c/data_security/)
