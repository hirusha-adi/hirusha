:::warning NOTE

This is completely my personal opinion.

I was trying to find a good client for whatsapp for Linux and that's when I came acress [Beeper (All your chats in one app. Yes, really.)](https://www.beeper.com/), but it is still not released publicly and you will have to join the waitlist to use it. After some digging around in the [r/beeper](https://www.reddit.com/r/beeper/) subreddit, I was able to find a working redeem key in this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/beeper/comments/18ep74x/beeper_cloud_referrals_thread/). 

## What is Beeper?

This app allows you combine all of your messaging apps into place. You can login in to each an every platform provided by Beeper and manage all of your chats within one application easily. You can also use iMessage on Android (and even on Windows Computers) after some setup, I don't have any comments about it since I'm completely on the Android ecosystem.

For me, what's interesting in it is combining all of my third party messaging apps and using all of them in one application.


## How it works?

It's fairly simple. First, we have the proprietary client application. According to them, they do this because they want to make some money off
