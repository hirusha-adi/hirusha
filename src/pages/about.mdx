## ðŸ¤“ A little about myself

I make websites. I take photos. I make discord bots. I make some more cool stuff every now and then. I know some pure maths. I teach somestimes.

My biggest flex is that I don't consume short-form content.

## ðŸ’» My tech stack

I mainly work with Javascript and Python on Arch Linux or Pop OS.
